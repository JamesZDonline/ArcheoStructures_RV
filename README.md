# Archaeo Structures
This project uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to autonomously detect archaeological features in satellite and historical aerial imagery. It leverages computer vision to dramatically upscale survey coverage compared to field-based survey methods. While field methods can cover 1-2 square kilometers a day, this form of CNN-aided virtual survey will enable tens or hundreds of thousands of square kilometers to be surveyed autonomously.  Systematic survey at this inter-regional scale promises to produce new insights into late prehistoric (~1000-1532 CE) and colonial-era (1532-1821 CE) settlement patterns, economic variation and change, and the effects of Spanish colonialism.

The project is situated in the western cordillera of the southern Peruvian Andes. This region is especially well-suited to survey from satellite imagery because the arid environment limits vegetation coverage that would otherwise obscure relevant features. The project focuses on archaeological sites with standing architectural remains visible in the imagery.  Relict buildings were primarily constructed from stone and therefore have maintained relatively good levels of preservation, making them readily visible in the imagery. However, because they are composed of the same materials as the background matrix (soil, rock), relict buildings are not spectrally distinct, making traditional remote sensing techniques ineffective. For this reason, we have trained a CNN to detect architectural features.
